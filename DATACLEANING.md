# Data Cleaning and Analysis Process

## Introduction
This document summarizes the data cleaning and analysis process conducted on the Walmart dataset. Our goal is to prepare the data for the modeling phase.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Content**: The dataset contains weekly sales, CPI, and other economic indicators.
- **Data Source**: Walmart

## Cleaning Process
1. **Missing Data Check**: Initially, we checked for any missing values in the dataset. Appropriate strategies were developed for missing data where necessary.
2. **Outlier Analysis**: We identified outliers and examined their effects. The sources of extreme values in the Weekly_Sales and CPI data were determined.
3. **Transformation Applications**:
   - **Log Transformation**: A log transformation was applied to Weekly_Sales.
   - **Box-Cox Transformation**: The CPI data was prepared for a Box-Cox transformation.

## Results
- **Distribution Analyses**: The distribution graphs of both original and transformed datasets were compared.
- **Preparation for Modeling**: The final state of the data and transformations were prepared for the modeling phase.

## Next Steps
- **Model Selection**: The use of robust models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting that are resistant to outliers.
- **Data Segmentation**: Data segmentation will be performed considering the bimodal nature of the CPI data.
